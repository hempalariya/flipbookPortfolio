## 💡 How It Works

- The `.book` container has multiple `.page` elements.
- Each `.page` has a `.front` and `.back`, representing the two sides of the page.
- On clicking **Next** or **Prev**, the page rotates using `transform: rotateY()` and updates the `z-index` to simulate page turning.
- The contact form is static (no backend) but styled and placed on the last page.
